What does puts do?

Returns nil, prints stuff in a new line
What is an integer? What is a float?

Integer is a digit without dot, float is decimal ( even 5.0 becouse it has the dot)
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Sooo... 5/3 = 1 (integer divided by integer = integer)

But... 6.0/12 = 0.5 (float divided by integer = float)

And... 1.2/0.2 = 0.6 (float divided by float = float)

Also... 6/6.0 = 1.0 (integer divided by float = float)

So to sum up, float is not pure decimal, becouse 6.0 in the mathematic world would be an integer. But Ruby consider it as a float.

Hours in a year
Minutes in a decade

```ruby
def count_hours_in_a_year

hours = 365 * 24
puts hours

end

count_hours_in_a_year



def count_minutes_in_a_decade(minutes)

minutes = 365 * 24 * 60 * 10
puts minutes

end

count_minutes_in_a_decade()
```

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

It was preatty easy. I learn basic about methods like reverse and upcase.
