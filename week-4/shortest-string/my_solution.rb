# Shortest String

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# shortest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the shortest string
#
# +list_of_words+ is an array of strings
# shortest_string(array) should return the shortest string in the +list_of_words+
#
# If +list_of_words+ is empty the method should return nil

#Your Solution Below
def shortest_string(list_of_words)
  # Your code goes here!
  list_of_words.min{|a,b| a.size <=> b.size }
  	


end


shortest_string(['cat', 'zzzzzzz', 'apples'])
