##  Think About Time 
I learnt that I should be as specific as I can when I am setting my goals. It will help me to set clear steps and timeline towards accomplishment of the goals. 

 

A time box is a determined time ( 10 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) after which we stop working and reflex on our job. I can use time box while developing in HTML/CSS. I would stop after every 20 minutes to determinate if I am actually building what I suppose to.

 

I manage my time by buying black close ( you don't have to think in the morning what to wear because everything fits :D ). I manage time by giving myself 3 things I have to accomplish each day ( no sleep if the task won't be accomplished :D ). 

 

My strategy sometimes does not work because of lack of discipline. For example I will be to tired to run, or I will waste to much time on grocery shopping/other things of little importance. 

 

I already started employing "tiny habits" advice. I started to run 20 minutes every day. Is not connected to developing, but for sure it teaches discipline. 

 

My plan is... to have a PLAN. Every Sunday I will set a plan of learning for the following week. I also going to give myself a gift if I meet my deadlines. 


##  The Command Line
Shell is a programming language. Bash is one of its implementation. Shell is like an interpreter. It can read, change and execute files. 

The most challenging was understanding popd and pushd commands. 

Yes, I successfully used all the commands. However I still working on popd and pushd commands as it outcomes sometimes surprises me. 

The most important is find, as it decreases the time for search. Also touch and mkdir, because it allows you to create files faster. 

-pwd it prints a directory that we are in

-ls it lists all the elements in directory

-mv it renames

-cd it goes inside directory 

-../ it goes to the parent directory 

-touch in creates a file 

-mkdir its creating a directory 

-less it is showing one page of the file

-rmdir it removes directory( if it is empty ) 

-rm removes a file 

-help it gives us commands names with explanations
