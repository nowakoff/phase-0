**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
1) I can change the size of my text
2) Position of divs ( which also teaches me more about positioning becouse I see changes in real time)
3) I can play with display ( use display inline, inline-block or block)
4) I can set margins, paddings, borders
5) I can float and clear elements
7) I can set some fix values
8) I can use Chrome DevTools as a wireframing 

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**
1) I can resize elements using fixed ( px ) or relative values ( %, em)
2) I can go to inspect.element window and play with element style setting some properties

**What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**
1) Absolute ( relative to parent )
2) Fixed ( relative to window )
3) Static ( element doesn't has any position)
4) Relative ( positioning from the point where element would normaly be )
Absolute was the hardest becouse you have to keep thinking about 2 elements instead of 1.

**What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?**
1) Border - (without padding) edges of the content  
2) Margin - space between border and others elements
3) Padding - space betweent content and border 

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**
I am generally in love in DevTools becouse they safe much time. I don;t go back and for to implement changes and se how they look on the page. I change things on site, then copy them and paste into my code.
