 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown",
  spouse: null,
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = { 
  name: "Adam",
};


terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;  
terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {name: ""};
terah.children.carson = {name: "Carson"};
terah.children.carter = {name: "Carter"};
terah.children.colton = {name: "Colton"};
adam.children = terah.children


// __________________________________________
// // Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines

// //What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
// I had trouble to pass the assigment an object to terah. 
// I tired to include it in the children object. 
// Finally I just assign everythin in one line to terah.

// //How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
// Easy, you just write delete beforeporperty.

// //What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
// //Thar i can create new properties and change old ones. 
// //
