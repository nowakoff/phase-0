What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
**Let's say I am building the site about Theatre. First I talk with the site owner about purpouse and content the website. Then based on his needs, I create a basic plan. I want him to aprove my idea so I am doing a quick design in PS. Once, my project is amroved I start developing using Agile ( I ask person about opinion as I go). When I finished, I testing the performence, funconality, UX. Last stage is updating his content when he needs it or adding new feature like: "Buy Ticket Online"**
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
**My site will contain portfolio of my design and wireframes as well as informative bloga  about developing. Beside description of dev concepts it will contain a chaatsheet for HTML, CSS, Git.. etc.  **
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
**My target audience are beginners devs ( blog is mainly for them ) and employers ( portfolio is mainly for them ). I woud try to play with key words and links to my site on relevant pages (SEO).**
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
**
First I would like him to see one piece of portfolio and one post. 
**
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
**
USER FIRST, don't assume that specific design is the best, ASK USER! 
**
What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
**I can talk months, but let's share 3 points.
GOOD UX CAN :
1. Can increase revenue (people resign from buying stuff if the design is not appiling or site is not easy to use)
2. Site will stay in users memory longer ( UX has techniques which allows user to relate to the site by placing specific images, colors, sounds, ect.  )
3. The range of users can decrease ( people will be encouraged to for example use online banking becouse process will be easy and intuitive- when befoure it could be painful, and they woud just go to rhe branch )**
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
**Creating map in WRITEMAPS ( since I used it for free, is not to responsive for my needs)**
