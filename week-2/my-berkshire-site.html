		ALEX COMMENTS
		- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		Nice, sweet and fast. HTML is much less scary than Terminal and Git merging. I didn't have much problems.
		- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
			Img tag is very explicit and easy to use. Beside DevB material I used 3W School to get more information about Sematic and Non-sematic elements in HTML5.
		- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
		Without problems. It was nice to focus only on content design. Like building house and starting with just fundaments.
		- What seems good and bad about HTML?
			Good thing is that HTML is very logical. Bad things is that some tags like table is not to manageable.
		- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		Putting all useful tags on cheatsheet.

		*What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		We didn't have much problem doing the skeleton berkshire site. It seemed like a nice way to ease
		into re-learning HTML, starting with such a simple website. It also helped that we didn't have to
		do any formatting, so it made creating the site even faster.

		*How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
		There were a lot of resources for HTML5 so it was pretty easy to find answers or guides on how to
		implement various things. I also have the recommended HTML/CSS book which I browsed through just
		before starting the pairing session with Alex, that also helped me a lot since the book shows
		visiually what a particular code does.

		*How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
		I really like not putting any formatting in the HTML. It's certainly a very different way of
		thinking from when I taught myself HTML a long time ago and I put all the design elements in the
		HTML itself. Back then, I feel like the code would get too big and complicated because all the
		elements are in just one file. Putting just the contents in the HTML and the design elements in
		CSS is something I am really excited to be learning. In regard to following this best practice
		while creating the site, I feel like Alex and I were able to stick to it pretty easily.

		*What seems good and bad about HTML?
		The good thing about it is since it is the language of the web, there are a lot of resource about
		it, any questions you might have, you can find an answer pretty easily. I also like the fact that
		it is very easy to test what you wrote.

		The bad thing about it is since it is so prevalent, there are so many badly written HTML so it's
		also easy to start doing these as well. Also, since a lot of people are using different browsers
		and different versions on different kind of devices, HTML might not always look the way you
		intended it to look.

		- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		For me, it is trying to remember what the acronyms stand for. For example <hr> is horizontal
		rule, <p> is for paragraph, <img src> is for image source. I also try to close the tags
		immediately after writing the opening tag.
