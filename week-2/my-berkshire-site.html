		ALEX COMMENTS 
		- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		Nice, sweet and fast. HTML is much less scary than Terminal and Git merging. I didn't have much problems. 
		- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
			Img tag is very explicit and easy to use. Beside DevB material I used 3W School to get more information about Sematic and Non-sematic elements in HTML5. 
		- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
		Without problems. It was nice to focus only on content design. Like building house and starting with just fundaments. 
		- What seems good and bad about HTML?
			Good thing is that HTML is very logical. Bad things is that some tags like table is not to manageable. 
		- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		Putting all useful tags on cheatsheet.
