# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline:

# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
  #fill in the outline here

# Check the called column for the number called.
  #fill in the outline here

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'
  #fill in the outline here

# Display a column to the console
  #fill in the outline here

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  #fill in the outline here

# Initial Solution

class BingoBoard

  def initialize(board)
    @bingo_board = board
  end


end

# Refactored Solution



#DRIVER CODE (I.E. METHOD CALLS) GO BELOW THIS LINE
